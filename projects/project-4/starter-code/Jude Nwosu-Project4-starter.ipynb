    "Answer: The problem statement of this project involves predicting the status of college-educated students seeking admission into the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Graduate School program for academic and professional advancement. The aim of this project is to predict which students are most likely to be admitted into the UCLA graduate program based on a combination of factors as Rank, representing the prestige of the institution attended for undergraduate studies; GPA; and GRE among others."

This information was also visible in the \"df.describe\".  \"df.hist()\" and \"pl.show()\" was used to obtain a visual inspection of the data I am working with."

    "Answer:  After loading the admissions data into the DataFrame and viewing its summary using .describe(), a dummy variable was creatd using \"Prestige\" as this is project is about Muliple Regression; hence the need for an n - 1 column set.  The 'admit', 'gre', 'gpa', and 'prestige' columns were used in the regression process.  A set of Histogram plots were used to depict the visuals for 'admit', 'gre', 'gpa', 'prestige' variables to understand the data.  The Odds Ratio was also used to determine a student's admittability based on the Prestige of the institution attended.  The data was also fitted to minimize the effect of outliers from the multiple independent variables and thereby resulting in predicted values close to the observed data values."

The higher the Prestige of the intitution attended by the student, the better their chances of getting accepted.  It can also be deduced from the results that a higher GPA is positively associated with a student's chances of admission into the grad program."
